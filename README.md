# STAT778 Homework 4
*Sean Steinle*

This is my submission for HW4 for STAT778 at GMU.

Info:
- `run_analysis_singular.sh` completes problem #1 and `run_analysis_array.sh` completes problem #2.
- I didn't do much data analysis for HW#3, so I reformed my script to write results to a CSV for easier analysis.
- I also encapsulated many of the 'helper' functions
